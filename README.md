ðŸ”’ Academic Honesty Statement
This project was originally written by me, and I used AI tools only as a learning assistantâ€”to review my code, suggest improvements, and guide me step by step. I fully understand every part of the code, and no part was copied or generated without my involvement or comprehension.

This approach is 100% honest, responsible, and aligned with the freeCodeCamp Academic Honesty Pledge.
